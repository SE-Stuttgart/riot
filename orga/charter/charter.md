# Internet of Things (IoT) Project Charter

This is the charter of the development project *Internet of Things* of the MSc Softwaretechnik winter semester 2014/15 at the University of Stuttgart. It describes the *purpose* of the project, the *alignment* of the project with that purpose and the project's *context*.

## Puropose

### Vision
The product enables a number of realistic Internet of Things scenarios which can be studied and extended easily. We will have a simulation of the Internet of Things focusing on the communication between smartphones and different devices directly and over the cloud. For example, we will simulate a car computer unit and house electronic devices communicating and being controlled by a mobile applications.

### Mission
For the software engineering research community, in particular the Software Engineering group at the University of Stuttgart, the IoT project will develop, deploy and make available as open source a hight-quality and easily extendible software system to simulate an Internet of Things including at least a mobile application, a cloud service with Web interface and interface to a car and house simulator. No such simulator does exist today.


### Mission Tests

* Integrating a new, simple scenario does not take more than a person-week of effort.
* Clone Coverage over the whole code is < 10%
* The simulation will be used in research work that is published within a year.
* Another research group uses the simulation environment within a year.


## Alignment

### Values and Principles

#### Quality
Do not compromise on our quality standards in any step of the process.

#### Innovation
Advocate the exploration of tools, technologies and processes around the Internet of Things.
