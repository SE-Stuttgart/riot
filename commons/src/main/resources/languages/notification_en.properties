# This file contains notification titles and messages. See the Notification class for details on that.
# By convention, the (simple) class name and the name of a NotificationEvent are used to construct the key of a notification.
# The NotifiationEvent "ee" in the Thing class "tt" will resolve to "tt_ee_title" and "tt_ee_message".
# Other notification keys can be created (arbitrarily) for other notification sources.
#
# Titles should be short and contain no punctuation. Messages should end with a period.
#
# The arguments {x} for the strings are the following:
# {thing.name} is the name of the thing that the message refers to. This may be empty.
# {thing.id} is the ID of the thing that the message refers to. This may be empty.
# {xxx} The source of a notification can provide arguments with arbitrary names.
